# Remote Desktop Connection via GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically create a remote desktop connection via Ngrok, allowing secure access to a Windows environment. Each GitHub Action execution generates an Ngrok tunnel that lasts for approximately 1 hour, enabling RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) access.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Setup**: Uses GitHub Actions to set up and configure a remote desktop session.
- **Secure Tunnel**: Ngrok provides a secure tunnel for RDP access.
- **Quick Access**: Each session lasts about 1 hour, with easy reconnection using the IP provided by Ngrok.
